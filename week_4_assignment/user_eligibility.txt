In Nigeria, assume that the only eligibility condition for voting are:
A user who is from Nigeria can vote regardless of their age
A user must be older than 18 if he/she is not a Nigerian
Write a javascript code that accepts the age, and country of any user (using the prompt box) one after the other.
If the user is eligible to vote based on the stated condition, alert(“You can vote”)
If the user does not satisfy the eligibility condition, alert(“You cannot vote”);
